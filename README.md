***Level 1 :*** 

At this  step you will have to abide to some rules: Compliance with Stop Signs, You must stop the vehicle full stop before the signpost and then give the right ahead before continuing your way. In addition during the road trip will be the edge of the road. The edge of the road is a very dangerous place and you should not be be there for non-emergency purposes. If you've already stopped there, stay away from traffic and be careful. Another important rule is that this should be correct behavior in a traffic circle,. Driving in a traffic circle is only allowed in one direction (in Israel: counterclockwise) and the forward right belongs to a vehicle that is already in the traffic circle. One last rule to be allowed at this speed limit. Currently the speed limit is __ and should not be exceeded.

***Level 2:***

 At this step you will have to deal with some additional rules. A continuous white line, by law, is strictly prohibited to cross a continuous white line. Crossing can be dangerous and lead to a car accident. In addition, you will have to obey traffic lights, in a red color you must stop , an orange color to prepare for driving, and in a green one you can drive. In addition, there will be pedestrians  during the trip, you have to be careful when they want to cross the road. Before pedestrian crossing
, stop if pedestrians want to cross the road.
There will  be road margins and speed limit as in the previous step.

***Level 3:***

At this step you will meet some new traffic rules. One-way road, when you notice a one-way traffic sign the law says that in this way you can only drive in one direction and traffic in the opposite direction is prohibited. Another rule that will appear at this step is No Enterence  signpost. This signpost means that entering this road for any vehicle is prohibited. Another situation you will meet at this step is a traffic jam. In traffic jams you must be patient and keep  distance from the vehicle in front of you to prevent an accident. In addition at this stage there will be traffic lights, traffic circle and margins as in the previous stages.

***Level 4:***

In the last step of the game you must pay attention to the important law of speed change in different ways. For example, when you enter an interstate, you need to lower the speed to 50 km / h. When you enter the highway the speed limit is usually 90 km / h. At this step in addition there will be pedestrians and traffic lights as in the previous stages
